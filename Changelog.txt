20081107 - 1.0
* Initial release

20081112 - 1.1
* Added ability to specify number of stacks to dump
* Limited dumping into mail to 12 stacks

20081113 - 1.2
* Added ability to specify item quality

20081128 - 1.3
* Fixed bug in numstacks (would dump 5 stacks from every bag instead of 5 total)
* Ace-ified
* moved strings to Dumpster-enUS.lua (for localization)
* rewrote option parsing
* added merchant frame
* added trade frame
* added bind status
* added tooltip search

20081203 - 1.4
* Changed some message texts, hopefully more clear
* Auto-selects merchant gossip if /din is used at an NPC (such as Innkeepers)
* Will now load on demand if ACP or AddonLoader is installed 

20090113 - 1.5
* Changed to load on demand only for AddonLoader
* Fixed /dall once and for good.  /dall dumps from every tab of the guild bank
* Updated embedded version of Ace
* Moved to searchoptions (so) dictionary for parameter passing.  No more 15-argument functions that all need to be updated with every new parameter!
* Added /full and /partial for only dumping full or partial stacks
* Added /dout for merchants (buys items). "/dout 4 Sacred Candle" will buy 4 Sacred Candles.  Note that if an item comes in stacks from the vendor (for example arrows come in stacks of 200), then the number refers to stacks.  "/dout 4 arrow" will actually buy 4 * 200 = 800 arrows
* Added /dout for mail (pulls items from your mail)
* Added /only parameter.  If you type "/dout 10 /only apple" and you have 3 apples in your inventory, Dumpster will only dump 7 additional apples.  Doesn't work with /dout on merchants

20090121 - 1.6
* Added /except parameter.  "/din /except apple" will dump everything except apples
* Added /remain parameter.  If you have 20 apples, "/din 2 /remain apple" will dump 18 of them.
* Removed a fair amount of code duplicaton.
* Changed option parsing to allow numbers anywhere - "/din 2 /full apple" vs "/din /full 2 apple"
* Changed some magic numbers to actual constants (for example BANK_CONTAINER instead of -1)
* Automatically set the mail to Inbox or SendMail frame depending on whether we're doing /din or /dout
* Added /to option for /din to mail.  "/din 2 apple /to HoboJoe" would mail 2 apples to HoboJoe.  /to is ignored other places
* Added command chaining.  "/din 2 apple; 3 block; 1 pear tree" will dump those items in sequence
* Fixed mail /dout skipping some messages.  Blizzard doesn't put mails in order or consecutively, so you just have to scan all 12 possible slots. Jerks.
* Slight speedup: don't get tooltip unless we're actually checking it

20090124 - 1.7
* Fixed bug in /dall only checking the first two tabs
* Fixed option parsing for /except

20090127 - 1.8
* fixed some bugs with /except
* rewrote option parsing to be more flexible.  This will allow easier adding of options, and prevent options from clobbering each other
* fixed a bug where /din to mail would add an unnecessary delay
* Added sets! Any command line you would normally use with Dumpster can be made a set.
	/dadd setname setdetails
	/ddel setname
	/dlist

	Example:
	/dadd frostbag /to mistertailor 60 Frostweave Cloth; 12 Infinite Dust; 2 Eternium Thread
	/din frostbag

20090305 - 1.9
* Added color based on status:
	green - dumped everything you asked for (which may be nothing in the case of /only)
	red - dumped nothing
	blue - dumped some, but not all
* Fixed a bug with dump counts when chaining commands
